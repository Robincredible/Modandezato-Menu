# Modandezato Menu
A backend-less interactive mini site, showcasing our products! A fun way to look at this site, quoting from the [Chromium Web Development Style Guide](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/ec3092c8d21e20e39698f5272c8a7f71c3ee88a2/styleguide/web/web.md), is to
see the `HTML as the Model`, `CSS as the View`, and `Javascript as the Control`, which is how we did the *Add to Order form* functionality.

## Why the Menu Site?
We made this primarily with the hopes of easing our customer's ordering experience by being able to fill up the form itself dynamically, 
instead of typing it all(including the labels) and browsing our Facebook/Instagram feed. The customer will be able to view the product images from the get-go whilst
*salivating on the lusciously decadent photographs*. 

### The Order Process
1. They can add products by tapping/clicking on the product images, and then pressing the `Add to Order Button`
2. Remove an item by pressing the `X Button`(*or rather the '+' rotated in 45 degrees*) from the `Product and Quantity Field` 
in the form at will with an automated calculator of the current price total. 
3. After filling the form, and then pressing the `Copy Order Form Button`, the texts of the order form populated with the customer's desired content will be copied into 
the clipboard and then they can just paste it in a direct message to one of our social media channels!

### Why the copy instead of a submission form?
In order to process an order, we need a screenshot of the bank transaction first(through a direct message, just to prove to us that it's you) as we don't have an option yet for 
cash on delivery. Submitting a form, and sending the contents through to a sheet or an email, and then checking it again through direct messages may just be redundant 
in the current process that is working for us.

Thank you for reading!

---*The form is still having problems rendering the modal on Huawei Browsers, Microsoft Edge Mobile and Chrome Versions < 87(tested as of 06/10/2021). We've put out a notice(if the browser currently does not meet the Chrome and Edge criterias, using [Platform JS](https://github.com/bestiejs/platform.js/)) to switch into the latest version of Chrome or update their browsers. We're currently looking into this. For now, the form has been tested to be working on the latest versions of Google Chrome, Firefox, Firefox Nightly, Firefox Focus, Firefox Lite, Opera, Opera Touch, Samsung Browsers and Duckduck Go*---
